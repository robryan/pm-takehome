# About Dataset
## Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist
Welcome! This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. We also released a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to `lat`/`lng` coordinates.

This is real commercial data, it has been anonymised, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses.

### Join it with the marketing funnel
We have also released [a Marketing Funnel Dataset](/data/marketing-funnel/). You may join both datasets and see an order from Marketing perspective! A quickstart on joining is [available here](https://www.kaggle.com/andresionek/joining-marketing-funnel-with-brazilian-e-commerce).

### Context
This dataset was generously provided by [Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces](www.olist.com). Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners.

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention
1. An order might have multiple items.
2. Each item might be fulfilled by a distinct seller.
3. All text identifying stores and partners where replaced by the names of Game of Thrones great houses.

#### Columns
For each file we offer column definitions and a row of example data

##### üôã <code>olist_customers_dataset.csv</code>

This dataset has information about the customer and its location. Use it to identify unique customers in the orders dataset and to find the orders delivery location.

<details>

In our system each order is assigned to a unique `customer_id`. This means that the same customer will get different ids for different orders. The purpose of having a `customer_unique_id` on the dataset is to allow you to identify customers that made repurchases at the store. Otherwise you would find that each order had a different customer associated with.

##### üõçÔ∏è <code>olist_order_items_dataset.csv</code>

<details>

###### Example
The `order_id` = `00143d0f86d6fbd9f9b38ab440ac16f5` has 3 items (same product). Each item has the freight calculated accordingly to its measures and weight. To get the total freight value for each order you just have to sum.

The total `order_item` value is: `21.33 * 3 = 63.99`

The total freight value is: `15.10 * 3 = 45.30`

The total order value (product + freight) is: `45.30 + 63.99 = 109.29`
